# Project 1 - Analyzing flight delays

This repo contains the assignment for Project 1, which analyzes flight delay data.

You will be graded through your GitHub repo. I will assess how well you did the following:

- completed the `fileio.ipynb` notebook,
- completed the `data-analysis.ipynb` notebook,
- completed the `visualization.ipynb` notebook.

Prepare your repo for grading by doing the following:

1. Export an environment.yml for the environment used for this lab.
1. Stage, commit, and push your environment.yml file (you can do this directly on master).
1. Update README.md with your contact information and commit information for grading (you can do this on GitHub).
